**JSTetris**
============

This #1000000 clone of Tetris was written purely in JavaScript with no special game engines, it consists of:
* HTML5 (canvas element)
* some CSS and
* a lot of JS scripts

Keep in mind that my aim wasn't to create a "super-brilliant-modern-tetris-with-cats", but I did it to learn writing
some larger application than JS HelloWorld. But I hope you'll enjoy it :)

TO DO list
----------
1. add a new version of current asset with smaller images (16x16 or 24x24 pixels per block)
2. change CSS to make app responsive (currently displaying isn't adapted to mobile devices)
3. detect type of device the game is running on to load proper asset

####**Used technologies:**
   * JavaScript
   * HTML5
   * CSS
   * Modernizr library
